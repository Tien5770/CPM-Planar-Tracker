# CPM-Planar-Tracker
## Description
    This is a planar tracker programme based on CPM.And it's a preliminary one,there are lots of problems to solve.
## CPM
    The CPM algorithm is described detailedly in [1].
    The original impletation is not for OpenCV.Therefore,a re-impletation [2] is used in the planar tracker.
## Test Data
    The test data is from [3].And the page of this project is [4]
